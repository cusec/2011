First as a developer in Ottawa, he coded algorithms, application programming interfaces (API) and graphical user interfaces (GUI) for many software applications used in manufacturing of integrated circuits (notably for Intel). Later in Belgium as an application engineer, he ran clean room experiments and published many papers. Martin was an intrapreneur at Synopsys; he prototyped a software toolkit to interface with metrology equipment in the clean room. He then settled in Montreal and became product manager to lead development and commercialization of that software application. After a decade of fun and challenges, Martin decided to jump into the adventure of a startup.</p>
<p class="wp">Martin’s passion is building software applications people love to use. Coding is easy, but getting people to use your application is hard, and getting them to love it is close to impossible. Yet it is his lifelong mission to accomplish just that.</p>
<p class="wp">Martin holds a bachelor in computer science, and an MBA from the University of Ottawa.</p>

<p class="title">Paul Kry</p>
<p class="wp">Paul Kry is an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University.  He obtained his Ph.D. in 2005 from the University of British Columbia, and has also spent two years in Grenoble at INRIA as a postdoctoral researcher. His research interests include physically based simulation, character animation, interaction, motion capture, and a variety of related topics.</p>
<p class="wp">This talk will give an introduction to physically based animation and present some recent developments from the McGill Computer Graphics Lab. Specifically, I will show a method for animating legged locomotion using only modal vibrations computed from the physical properties of an articulated character. I will also present an approach for simulating elastic deformable models at a coarse level while taking into account fine details such as topology and varying material properties. Come to this talk if you would like to gain intuition about fundamental techniques for physics based animation and development of simulation software.</p>

<p class="title">Derek Ruths</p>
<p class="wp">My work concerns predicting the behavior of complex, living systems: from cells to societies. Because limited (and often unreliable) data are available for such systems, I’m particularly interested in mathematical and computational techniques that use easy-to-obtain, structural attributes of the systems to predict how they will change over time. This interest has lead me to work in a variety of areas from cancer biology, to Roman history, to the growth of online social networks.</p>

<p class="wp">Experimental projects with music, dance, time-based visual art, electronic textiles, augmented reality games and theater provide fertile opportunities for applications of machine perception, real-time and parallel computation, digital signal processing, computer graphics, and computational physics. Questions of gesture and agency have profoundly shifted from earlier computational and cognitive models to alternative perspectives of embodiment and materiality. How do our notions of gesture and agency change in the presence of real-time, dynamically varying computational media?</p>
<p class="wp">Over the past 10 years, the Topological Media Lab&#8217;s has built responsive spaces  as apparatuses to explore such questions about gesture and agency.   I will show some of the lab&#8217;s creations, and share some insights learned working with teams of students and researchers from computer science, performing arts, studio arts, and architecture.</p>
