<p class="wp">It was in 1997 that Genetec was incorporated as a software research and development company. In those days, analog security systems were most commonly used to protect and monitor physical spaces. Users accepted the limitations inherent to analog security systems. Genetec’s engineers had the intuition that the typical analog or digital point-to-point telecom architecture would be short lived. More so, Genetec believed that the direction of the future was the multipoint to multipoint networked architecture. The sophisticated intelligence of software created to manage a complex network offered a major opportunity and would usher in new possibilities to customers worldwide. Thus, Genetec pioneered the first fully IP-based security system. Despite industry scepticism of this new market technology, Genetec’s team developed and perfected the solution.</p>
<p class="wp">We were the first to offer you IP video surveillance, and have extended our expertise in IP security to access control and license plate recognition (LPR).</p>
<p class="wp">Genetec’s security solutions are deployed throughout industries such as city-wide surveillance, education, gaming, government, law enforcement, parking enforcement, retail, transportation and many more. The open architecture of our solutions enables integration with one another, as well as with third-party solutions, letting customers leverage investments and lower total cost of ownership.</p>

<p class="wp">TandemLaunch collaborates with universities and independent inventors across the world to identify commercially viable innovation in the areas of video, audio and online multi-media consumer technology.

The project is funded entirely by TandemLaunch and staffed with appropriate engineers and business development experts from our in-house staff.</p>
<p class="wp">This team works closely with the inventors to bring the project from the whiteboard to a commercial package suitable for sale to the larger consumer electronics industry. Usually this involves the reduction of key risks through proof of concept systems, the fabrication of impressive demonstrators, and the establishment of a solid intellectual property portfolio for the invention. Meanwhile our business development experts work closely with our industry network to gather feedback and ultimate place the technology with an interested party.</p>
